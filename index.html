            <h4>1. What kinds of information do we collect?</h4>
            <p class="mb-0">Our Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect and use personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our Service. We also provide you with the lawful basis for the processing of personal information. We will not use or share your Personal Information with anyone.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>When using Beep, there are general elements of our service that you should know.</li>
              <li>Your network is defined by your company or organization’s email domain.</li>
              <li>To join a network, you must confirm your email address and it must match the email domain of your company.</li>
              <li>Only people in your network can view other member profiles and feeds.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>1.1. Profile information</h5>
            <p>You will provide us with Personal Information, such as your name and email address when you register a Member account with Beep or within the profile settings of the Service. You may also choose to add information, such as a photo, to your profile.</p>

            <h5>1.2. User content</h5>
            <p>Our Service offers its users the opportunity to share User Content – for example, if you post something in a group and you choose to use these features, you should be aware that any Personal Information you submit through these features can be read, collected, or used by the admin of these groups. We are not responsible for the official Information you choose to submit in these forums.</p>

            <h5>1.3. Invite Colleagues</h5>
            <p>We utilize a share link feature to help you keep in touch with your fellow colleagues who are on Beep Pakistan. When you join a network, we will ask you if you wish to invite or follow your colleagues from your same domain or other network. If you indicate that you would like to follow them, we will send them an invitation to activate the Beep Pakistan account and join the same domain/other network as you.</p>

            <h5>1.4. Your Device information</h5>
            <p class="mb-0">We also intend to collect information from or about the computers, phones, or other devices where you install or access our Services, depending on the permissions you’ve granted. We may associate the information we collect from your different devices, which helps us provide consistent Services across your devices. Here are some examples of the device information we collect:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Attributes, such as the information regarding operating system, access permissions (microphone & camera), software names, types, signal strength, and device identifiers.</li>
              <li>Device locations, including specific geographic locations, such as GPS in order to track workforce real-time location on-site.</li>
              <li>Connection information, including the name of your mobile operator, browser type, language and time zone, mobile phone number, and IP address.</li>
              <li>Only admins can receive information about your Profile and your activities performed on our service for robust incident response. However, also note that this is not user-published data or Geo location tracking. This will be log-based tracking. e.g. if an accident accrued and the audit/inspection team is required to audit, then we will provide only logs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. How do we use this information?</h4>
            <p>Personal/official information includes user’s email, phone name, picture, designation, LinkedIn and Twitter ID links.</p>

            <p>We will use your Personal and Service Usage Information to respond to your requests and to provide you with our product and service offerings. Beep will not share, rent or sell your Personal Information to other parties as the information is only stored on NTC Local Servers.

            <h5>2.3. Promote safety and security</h5>
            <p>We use the information we have to help verify accounts and activity, and to promote safety and security on and off of our Services, such as by investigating suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies.

            <h4>3. Cookie Policy</h4>
            <h5>3.1. Why do we use cookies?</h5>
            <p class="mb-0">We may use “cookies” on or in connection with our mobile app and Service to maintain information about you. A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. Beep employs the use of both “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your device after you close your app. Persistent cookies may be used by your app on subsequent visits to the Service. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your app. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your device’s directions or by removing them from the app's storage settings:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>iOS: Settings > Beep Pakistan > Clear Data</li>
              <li>Android: Settings > Apps > Beep Pakistan > Storage > Clear Data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Cookies help us provide, protect and improve Beep Pakistan, such as by personalizing content, and tailoring and providing a safer experience.</p>

            <h5>3.2. Session Cookies</h5>
            <p>The cookies that we use include session cookies, which are deleted when you close your app, and persistent cookies, which stay in your app until they expire or you delete them.</p>

            <h5>3.3. IP Address and Clickstream Data</h5>
            <p>Our servers automatically collect data about your Internet Protocol address when you use the Beep application. Our servers may log your IP Address, the resources you visit on the service; the website you visit after our Application; other information about the type of web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Service and other web usage activity and data logged by our web servers. We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our servers, and to administer our Service. Such information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider. We may also link this information with Personal Information.</p>

            <h4>4. Legally Compelled Disclosures</h4>
            <p>We may disclose your Personal Information if required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with a judicial or court order or comply with legal process served on us or Affiliated Parties; (b) protect and defend our rights and property, the Service, the users of the Service, and/or our Affiliated Parties; or (c) act under circumstances to protect the safety of users of our Service.</p>

            <h5>4.1 Your Access and Correction Rights</h5>
            <p>You retain the right to decline to submit Personal Information through the Beep app, in which case Beep services may not be able to provide certain services to you. However, if you choose to provide Personal Information to us, we will provide you with the ability to access, correct, update or delete the Personal Information you have provided to Beep by emailing support@beep.gov.pk. We will respond to your request within 30 days. However, before we are able to provide you with any information or correct any inaccuracies, we may ask you to verify your identity and provide other details to help us to respond to your request.</p>

            <h5>4.2 Legal Basis for Processing of the Information</h5>
            <p class="mb-2">At any point while we are in possession of or processing official data provided by you, as a user, you have the following rights:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Right of rectification – you have a right to correct data that we hold about you that is inaccurate or incomplete.</li>
              <li>Right of access – you have the right to access your personal information by requesting a copy of the information that we hold about you. * The user will email from their registered official email to the NITB nominated admin, and the NITB admin will respond back from his/her official email to the concerned user.</li>
              <li>Right to restriction of processing – where certain conditions apply you have a right to restrict the processing.</li>
            </ol>
